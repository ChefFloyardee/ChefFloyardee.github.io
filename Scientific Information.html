			<center><h2>"The Chef Floyardee Science Curricula"</h2></center>
			<p>I've taught several different classes over the years, but the main courses that <i>The Chef</i> has <i>directed</i> have been Middle School Life Science, Middle School Physical+General Science, and High School Environmental Science (with a focus on the PA Envirothon!)! I've poured my heart and soul into creating the most engaging, interesting, and exciting lessons possible for these courses, and in doing so I've essentially created my own Science Curriculum which I call "The Chef Floyardee Science Curricula"! I've had to adapt part of this over the years to align with changing standards and district policies but the heart and soul (and thus all of the FUN things we do to LEARN SCIENCE in MR. FLOYD'S CLASS!) of what I do has remained the same, so HERE IT IS!</p>
			<p><i>Note! Each course is divided up into 30 Academic Weeks, which is equivalent to 150 School Days allowing me to allot and allocate ≈30 School Days for standardized testing, weather events, school events, etc! EVERY SINGLE SECOND of EVERY SINGLE ACADEMIC DAY is utilized in Mr. Floyd's Class as well since we, always and forever, WORK BELL 2 BELL, so each School Day is thus jam-packed with a DO NOW, a QP, some HW (Herework/Homework), and a daily $CI FACT (to MAKE SURE that NO MATTER WHAT you LEARN at least ONE NEW THING on EVERY SINGLE DAY!) related to the day's TOPIC!</i></p>
